/**
 * OpenAPI configuration removed.
 * 
 * Email-worker is a Kafka consumer worker service, not a REST API.
 * It only exposes actuator endpoints for health checks and metrics.
 * OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is not needed for worker services.
 * 
 * If OpenAPI documentation is needed in the future, add springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui
 * dependency to email-worker/pom.xml and uncomment this configuration.
